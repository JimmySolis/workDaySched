 We can now add important events to a daily planner so that we can manage my time effectively.
 When we open the planner the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
 When we scroll down we are presented with timeblocks for standard business hours.
We can  view the timeblocks for that day each timeblock it is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
We can click into a timeblock and enter an event.
When I click the save button for that timeblock the text for that event is saved in local storage.
When refreshed the content is still updated.
